# Bug Fix Summary: Failed to get feature by ID - Invalid URL

## Problem
The GreenLightCI action was failing with the error:
```
Error: ❌ GreenLightCI encountered an error
Error: Failed to get feature by ID: top-level-await: Invalid URL
```

## Root Causes Identified

### 1. **ESM Loading Issue**
- The `web-features` package (v0.8.6) is ESM-only
- The compiled action tried to use `require()` which fails with `ERR_REQUIRE_ESM`
- When web-features failed to load, feature lookups returned undefined
- This caused downstream issues with URL validation in the GitHub reporting logic

### 2. **Outdated Dependencies**
- Project was using `web-features@0.8.6` (released ~2023)
- Many features including `top-level-await` weren't available in this version
- Latest version is `3.3.0` with significantly more features

### 3. **Incorrect Feature ID Mapping**
- Parser detected features with IDs like `css-nesting`, `optional-chaining`, `private-fields`
- These IDs don't exist in web-features:
  - `css-nesting` should be `nesting`
  - JavaScript language features (optional chaining, private fields, etc.) aren't tracked by web-features
  - web-features focuses on Web Platform APIs and CSS features, not ECMAScript syntax

## Solutions Implemented

### 1. **Robust ESM/CommonJS Loading** (`src/shared/baseline.ts`)
```typescript
// Try multiple strategies to load web-features:
// 1. Dynamic import (ESM-compatible)
// 2. require() fallback
// 3. Local JSON snapshot fallback (for bundled CommonJS)
```

**Changes:**
- Added dynamic import using Function constructor
- Handle both v0.x (default export) and v3.x (named `features` export)
- Fallback to local snapshot for bundled environments
- Better error handling and logging

### 2. **Upgraded Dependencies** (`package.json`)
```json
{
  "dependencies": {
    "web-features": "^3.3.0"  // was: "^0.8.6"
  }
}
```

**Benefits:**
- Access to 1000+ features including `top-level-await`
- Better baseline data and browser support information
- More accurate compatibility checking

### 3. **Fixed Feature ID Mapping** (`src/parser.ts`)

**Changed:**
- `css-nesting` → `nesting` (correct web-features ID)
- Removed detection of pure ECMAScript features not in web-features:
  - ❌ `optional-chaining` (not tracked)
  - ❌ `nullish-coalescing` (not tracked)
  - ❌ `private-fields` (not tracked)
  - ❌ `dynamic-import` (too broad, part of `js-modules`)
- ✅ Kept `top-level-await` (now available in v3.3.0)

**Added Documentation:**
```typescript
// NOTE: Most JavaScript language features (optional chaining, nullish coalescing,
// private fields, etc.) are ECMAScript spec features, not "web features" tracked
// by the web-features package. The web-features package focuses on Web Platform
// APIs and CSS features, not core JavaScript syntax.
```

### 4. **Updated Test Suite** (`test-baseline.js`)
- Updated feature IDs to match actual web-features data
- Added comments explaining which features are tracked
- All 10 test features now pass

## Files Modified

1. **src/shared/baseline.ts**
   - Enhanced `loadWebFeatures()` function
   - Support for both v0.x and v3.x export formats
   - Robust fallback strategies

2. **src/parser.ts**
   - Fixed `css-nesting` → `nesting`
   - Removed non-existent feature detections
   - Added documentation about feature scope

3. **test-baseline.js**
   - Updated test feature list
   - Fixed expectations

4. **package.json**
   - Upgraded `web-features` to 3.3.0

## Test Results

### Before Fix
```
Results: 5 found, 6 not found, 0 errors
❌ Test failed
```

### After Fix
```
✅ top-level-await: Top-level await (widely)
✅ container-queries: Container queries (widely)
✅ has: :has() (newly)
✅ grid: Grid (widely)
✅ subgrid: Subgrid (newly)
✅ nesting: Nesting (newly)
✅ custom-properties: Custom properties (widely)
✅ flexbox: Flexbox (widely)
✅ fetch: Fetch (widely)
✅ js-modules: JavaScript modules (widely)

Results: 10 found, 0 not found, 0 errors
✅ Test passed - baseline feature loading works!
```

## Build Status
✅ TypeScript compiled successfully
✅ Action bundled successfully (dist/index.js)
✅ All tests passing

## Next Steps
1. Test the action in a live GitHub Actions workflow
2. Update README with supported features
3. Consider adding integration tests
4. Document the feature detection scope

## Notes for Maintainers

### Feature Detection Scope
- ✅ **CSS Features**: All CSS features tracked by web-features
- ✅ **Web Platform APIs**: DOM APIs, fetch, etc.
- ✅ **Module Features**: top-level await, JS modules
- ❌ **ECMAScript Syntax**: Not tracked (optional chaining, private fields, etc.)

### Polyfill Suggestions
The `polyfills.ts` file still contains suggestions for ECMAScript features even though they're not tracked by web-features. This is intentional - they provide helpful fallback information for developers even if baseline data isn't available.

### Future Improvements
1. Add a feature ID validation step to catch mismatches early
2. Create a mapping file for common aliases (css-nesting → nesting)
3. Add support for detecting ESNext features via static analysis
4. Consider using a separate data source for ECMAScript features
